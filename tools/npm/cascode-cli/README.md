@cascode/cascode-cli (npm wrapper)

This package enables a one-line install of the Cascode CLI via npm:

    npm install -g @cascode/cascode-cli

How it works
- On install, a small script downloads a prebuilt, self-contained `cascode` binary
  for your OS/architecture from the GitHub Releases page.
- The `cascode` command is provided via the package `bin` and forwards args to the binary.

Environment variables
- `CASCODE_DOWNLOAD_BASE` (optional): override the GitHub Releases base URL, e.g.
  `https://your.mirror.example.com/cascode/releases/download`.
- `CASCODE_VERSION` (optional): if set, use this version instead of `package.json`.

Fallbacks
- If a prebuilt binary cannot be downloaded (e.g., due to network policy), you can
  install the .NET global tool version:

    dotnet tool install -g Cascode.Cli

Notes
- Release artifacts are expected to be named `cascode-<rid>.<zip|tar.gz>`, where rid is one of:
  `win-x64`, `win-arm64`, `osx-x64`, `osx-arm64`, `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`.
- The repositoryâ€™s release workflow should publish those assets alongside tags matching the npm package version.
